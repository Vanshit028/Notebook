# 1. concat()  

It combines two or more arrays and returns a new array.

```javascript
let arr1 = [1,2,3];
let arr2 = [5,4,6];
let arr3 = [7,8,9];

// to join 2 array
console.log(arr1.concat(arr2))

// to join more than 2 array
console.log(arr1.concat(arr2,arr3))
```

<hr style="background: red; border-radius: 2px;">

# 2. copyWithin()

Syntax
```array-name.copyWithin(target, start, end)```

```javascript
let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Copy elements starting from index 0 to index 2 (exclusive) to index 3 onwards
array.copyWithin(3, 0, 2);

// Output :  [1, 2, 3, 1, 2]
```

* target is 3, indicating that we want to start copying to index 3 in the array. [means the copied part will be pasted from here.]
* start is 0, indicating we begin copying from index 0.
* end is 2, indicating we stop copying before index 2 (i.e., copying indexes 0 and 1).

As a result, elements [1, 2] are copied to indices 3 and 4, effectively overwriting the existing elements 4 and 5.

> 1. In Case of longer array
> ```javascript
> let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
> 
> // Copy elements starting from index 0 to index 2 (exclusive) to index 3 onwards
> array.copyWithin(3, 0, 2);
> 
> // Output :  [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 6]
> ```
> 
> Note : It only change that number of element which is being copied.
> 
> 2. In Case of shorter array
> ```javascript
> let array = [1, 2, 3, 4];
> 
> // Copy elements starting from index 0 to index 2 (exclusive) to index 3 onwards
> array.copyWithin(3, 0, 2);
> 
> // Output :  [1, 2, 3, 1]
> ```

<hr style="background: red; border-radius: 2px;">

# 3. delete()

```javascript
let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Using delete to remove an element at a specific index
delete array[2];

console.log(array); // Output: [1, 2, empty, 4, 5]
```

* delete array[2] removes the element at index 2.
* However, the array still maintains its length, and the deleted index becomes undefined (not truly removed).



> Note :
> 
> Why delete is Limited for Arrays?   
> 
> delete does not shift the remaining elements of the array. It leaves an "empty" slot with undefined value.
> 
> It doesn't update the length property of the array, so the array's size remains unchanged.
> 
> So using splice is recommend.


<hr style="background: red; border-radius: 2px;">

# 4. every()

Syntax ```array_name.every(callback(element, index, array), thisArg)```

* callback: A function to test each element of the array.
  * element: The current element being processed.
  * index (Optional): The index of the current element being processed.
  * array (Optional): The array every was called upon.
* thisArg (Optional): An object to use as this when executing the callback.

```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Check if all elements are less than 10
let allLessThanTen = numbers.every((element) => {
    return element < 10;
});

console.log(allLessThanTen); // Output: true

// Check if all elements are even
let allEven = numbers.every((element) => {
    return element % 2 === 0;
});

console.log(allEven); // Output: false
```

<hr style="background: red; border-radius: 2px;">

# 5. flat()  

Syntax ```flat(depth)```

* Depth → 1,2,… | infinity
* Depth value 1 is by default
* Infinity allows to concat array of any depth in one array.

```javascript
// Eg 1 ⇒
const myArr = [1, 2, [3, [4, 5, 6]]];
const newArr = myArr.flat(2);
// Output → [1,2,3, [ 4,5,6 ] ]

// Eg 2 ⇒
const myArr = [1, 2, [3, [4, 5, 6]]];
const newArr = myArr.flat(infinity);
// Output → [1,2,3, 4,5,6 ]
```

Concept of Depth :

# <img src="Array img/Flat()  .jpg" style="width:20rem; height:15rem; border:5px solid red;">

<hr style="background: red; border-radius: 2px;">

# 6. fill()  

Syntax ```array_name.fill(value, start, end)```

* value: The value to fill the array with.
* start (Optional): The index to start filling the array (default is 0).
* end (Optional): The index (exclusive) to stop filling the array (default is array.length).

1. Filling with a Single Value

```javascript
let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Fill the entire array with the value 0
array.fill(0);

console.log(array); // Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

2. Filling with a Value from a Start Index

```javascript
let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Fill starting from index 2 with the value 10
array.fill(10, 2);

console.log(array); // Output: [1, 2, 10, 10, 10]
```

3. Filling with a Value within a Range

```javascript
let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Fill from index 1 to index 3 (exclusive) with the value 7
array.fill(7, 1, 3);

console.log(array); // Output: [1, 7, 7, 4, 5]
```

Considerations

* Be cautious when using fill() on <b class="red_mark">arrays containing objects or nested arrays</b> . The method fills the array with references to the same object or array, not copies of the object/array.

1. In case of array of object.
```javascript
// Creating an array of objects
const person = { name: 'Alice' };
const array = new Array(3).fill(person);

console.log(array);
// Output: [ { name: 'Alice' }, { name: 'Alice' }, { name: 'Alice' } ]

// Modifying the first element
array[0].name = 'Bob';

console.log(array);
// Output: [ { name: 'Bob' }, { name: 'Bob' }, { name: 'Bob' } ]
```

>* We create an object person with a name property.   
>* We then create an array array with a length of 3 using new Array(3).   
>* We use fill(person) to fill the entire array with references to the same person object.   
>* Initially, all elements of array point to the same person object.   
>* When we modify the name property of the first element (array[0]) to 'Bob', this change is reflected in all elements of array because they all reference the same object.   

2. In case of nested array
```javascript
// Example with nested arrays
const nestedArray = new Array(2).fill([1, 2, 3]);

console.log(nestedArray);
// Output: [ [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3] ]

nestedArray[0][0] = 99;

console.log(nestedArray);
// Output: [ [99, 2, 3], [99, 2, 3] ]
```
> In this case, modifying an element within one of the nested arrays affects all instances because they all reference the same array object


* Use Array.from() or other techniques to create a new array if you need to avoid modifying the original array.

<hr style="background: red; border-radius: 2px;">

# 7. filter()

Syntax ```const newArray = array.filter(callback(element, index, array), thisArg);```

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Filter out even numbers
const oddNumbers = numbers.filter((num) => {
  return num % 2 !== 0;
});

console.log(oddNumbers); // Output: [1, 3, 5]
```

* The filter() method iterates through each element of the numbers array.
* For each element, the callback function (num) => num % 2 !== 0 is executed.
* If the callback function returns true (meaning the number is odd), the element is included in the oddNumbers array.

### More Example

1. Filtering by String Length

```javascript
const words = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "kiwi"];

// Filter words with length greater than 5
const longWords = words.filter((word) => {
  return word.length > 5;
});

console.log(longWords); // Output: ["banana", "orange"]
```

2. Filtering Based on Object Property

```javascript
const persons = [
  { name: "Alice", age: 30 },
  { name: "Bob", age: 25 },
  { name: "Charlie", age: 35 }
];

// Filter persons older than 30
const olderPersons = persons.filter((person) => {
  return person.age > 30;
});

console.log(olderPersons);
// Output: [{ name: "Charlie", age: 35 }]
```

### Use Cases

* Filtering out unwanted elements from an array based on specific criteria (e.g., removing null or undefined values).
* Extracting elements that meet certain conditions (e.g., extracting names that start with a specific letter from an array of names).
* Creating a subset of an array based on complex filtering logic (e.g., filtering based on multiple conditions or calculations).

### Considerations

* Use filter() when you need to create a subset of an array based on specific conditions without modifying the original array.
* The callback function should be pure (i.e., it should not mutate state outside its scope) for predictable behavior.

<hr style="background: red; border-radius: 2px;">

# 8. find()

Syntax ```const result = array.find(callback(element, index, array), thisArg);```

```javascript
const numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

// Find the first element greater than 25
const foundNumber = numbers.find((num) => {
  return num > 25;
});

console.log(foundNumber); // Output: 30
```

* The find() method iterates through each element of the numbers array.
* For each element, the callback function (num) => num > 25 is executed.
* The first element that satisfies the condition (num > 25) is 30, so 30 is returned as the result of find().

1. Finding Object by Property

```javascript
const users = [
  { id: 1, username: "alice" },
  { id: 2, username: "bob" },
  { id: 3, username: "charlie" }
];

// Find user object with username "bob"
const foundUser = users.find((user) => {
  return user.username === "bob";
});

console.log(foundUser); // Output: { id: 2, username: "bob" }
```

2. Finding Nearest Value

```javascript
const values = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25];

// Find the nearest value to 18
const nearestValue = values.find((value) => {
  return Math.abs(value - 18) < 5; // Check if difference is less than 5
});

console.log(nearestValue); // Output: 20
```

### Key Points

* The original array remains unchanged; find() does not mutate the array on which it is called.
* If no element satisfies the condition specified by the callback function, undefined is returned.

### Use Cases

* Finding an element in an array based on a specific criterion (e.g., finding the first occurrence of a number greater than a certain value).
* Searching for an object in an array based on a property (e.g., finding a user object with a specific username).
* Implementing custom search logic based on complex conditions (e.g., searching for the nearest value to a given number).

### Considerations

* find() stops iterating as soon as the first matching element is found. If multiple elements satisfy the condition, only the first one encountered is returned.
* If you need to find the index of the element instead of the element itself, consider using findIndex() method.

find() is a versatile method commonly used for searching and locating elements in arrays based on specific criteria. It provides a concise and efficient way to implement custom search logic in JavaScript.


<hr style="background: red; border-radius: 2px;">

# 9. findIndex()

Syntax ```const index = array.findIndex(callback(element, index, array), thisArg);```

```javascript
const numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

// Find the index of the first element greater than 25
const index = numbers.findIndex((num) => {
  return num > 25;
});

console.log(index); // Output: 2 (index of element 30)
```

* The findIndex() method iterates through each element of the numbers array.
* For each element, the callback function (num) => num > 25 is executed.
* The first element that satisfies the condition (num > 25) is 30, and its index is 2, so 2 is returned as the result of findIndex().

1. Finding Index of Object by Property

```javascript
const users = [
  { id: 1, username: "alice" },
  { id: 2, username: "bob" },
  { id: 3, username: "charlie" }
];

// Find the index of user object with username "bob"
const index = users.findIndex((user) => {
  return user.username === "bob";
});

console.log(index); // Output: 1 (index of user object with username "bob")
```

2. Finding Index of Nearest Value

```javascript
const values = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25];

// Find the index of the nearest value to 18
const index = values.findIndex((value) => {
  return Math.abs(value - 18) < 5; // Check if difference is less than 5
});

console.log(index); // Output: 3 (index of element 20, nearest to 18)
```

### Key Points

* findIndex() returns the index of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function.
* If no element satisfies the condition specified by the callback function, findIndex() returns -1.
* The callback function is invoked with three arguments:
  * element: The current element being processed.
  * index (Optional): The index of the current element.
  * array (Optional): The array findIndex() was called upon.
* The original array remains unchanged; findIndex() does not mutate the array on which it is called.

### Use Cases

* Finding the index of an element in an array based on a specific criterion (e.g., finding the index of the first occurrence of a number greater than a certain value).
* Implementing custom search logic to locate the position of an element based on complex conditions (e.g., searching for the index of an object with a specific property value).

### Considerations

* findIndex() stops iterating as soon as the first matching element is found. If multiple elements satisfy the condition, only the index of the first one encountered is returned.
* Use findIndex() when you need to find the position (index) of an element in an array based on specific criteria.
* If you need to access the element itself rather than its index, use find() method instead.

findIndex() is a useful method for implementing search functionality in JavaScript applications, providing a straightforward way to locate the position of elements within arrays based on custom conditions.

# 10. forEach()

Syntax ``````

```javascript

```

<hr style="background: red; border-radius: 2px;">

# 11. from()
It is a static method in JavaScript that creates a new, shallow-copied array instance from an array-like or iterable object. It provides a flexible way to create a new array based on existing data or a sequence of values.

Syntax ```Array.from(arrayLike[, mapFn[, thisArg]])```

* arrayLike: An array-like or iterable object to convert to an array.
* mapFn (Optional): A mapping function to call on each element of the array-like object.
  * This function is called with the current element, index, and the this value (provided by thisArg).
* thisArg (Optional): Value to use as this when executing the mapFn.

1. Converting a String to an Array

```javascript
let str = "hello";
let charArray = Array.from(str);

console.log(charArray); // Output: ["h", "e", "l", "l", "o"]
```

2. Mapping Each Element During Conversion

```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

// Create a new array by doubling each element of numbers
let doubledArray = Array.from(numbers, (num) => num * 2);

console.log(doubledArray); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8]
```

3. Using with Set or Map

```javascript
let set = new Set([1, 2, 3, 4]);

// Convert Set to Array
let arrayFromSet = Array.from(set);

console.log(arrayFromSet); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

### Key Points

* Array.from() can be used to convert any iterable object (like strings, Sets, Maps, etc.) or array-like objects (like NodeList, arguments object) into a new array.
* When mapFn is provided, it allows transformation of each element during the conversion process.
* The resulting array from Array.from() is a new array, not a reference to the original array or object.
* Array.from() can be used as an alternative to methods like slice() or spread syntax ([...iterable]) depending on the use case.

### Considerations

* If you need deep copying of nested objects or arrays within the iterable, Array.from() only performs a shallow copy. Use other methods like JSON.parse(JSON.stringify# ()) or custom deep cloning functions for deep copies.

### Use Cases

* Converting strings to arrays of characters.
* Transforming iterable objects (like Sets, Maps) into arrays for easier manipulation.
* Creating new arrays based on existing arrays or array-like objects with custom transformations.

Array.from() is a versatile method that's commonly used for data manipulation and conversion tasks in JavaScript.

<hr style="background: red; border-radius: 2px;">

# 12. indexOf()

Syntax ```const index = array.indexOf(searchValue, startIndex);```

* searchValue: The value to search for within the array.
* startIndex (Optional): The index at which to begin the search (default is 0).

```javascript
const numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

// Find the index of value 30 in the array
const index = numbers.indexOf(30);

console.log(index); // Output: 2 (index of value 30)
```

1. Finding Index of Element Starting from a Specific Index

```javascript
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "kiwi", "banana"];

// Find the index of "banana" starting from index 2
const index = fruits.indexOf("banana", 2);

console.log(index); // Output: 4 (index of second occurrence of "banana")
```

### Key Points

* indexOf() returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified searchValue within the array.
* If the searchValue is not found in the array, indexOf() returns -1.
* The search starts from the startIndex (if provided) and proceeds towards the end of the array.
* The comparison of values is strict (using ===), so the type and value must match for indexOf() to consider them equal.

### Use Cases

* Finding the index of a specific element in an array.
* Checking for the existence of a value in an array and retrieving its position.
* Implementing basic search functionality for arrays.

### Considerations

* indexOf() only finds the first occurrence of the specified value. To find subsequent occurrences, use indexOf() with a startIndex parameter or loop through the array manually.
* Use includes() method if you only need to check for the existence of a value (true or false), rather than getting its index.

### Compatibility

* indexOf() is supported in all modern browsers and is part of ECMAScript 5 (ES5) standard.

indexOf() is a fundamental method for searching and retrieving values within arrays in JavaScript. It provides a simple and efficient way to perform basic search operations.

<hr style="background: red; border-radius: 2px;">

# 13. includes()

Syntax ```const isIncluded = array.includes(searchElement, startIndex);```

* searchElement: The value to search for within the array.
* startIndex (Optional): The index at which to begin the search (default is 0).

```javascript
const numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

// Check if the value 30 is included in the array
const isIncluded = numbers.includes(30);

console.log(isIncluded); // Output: true
```

1. Checking for Multiple Values

```javascript
const colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];

// Check if "green" or "yellow" is included in the array
const isGreenIncluded = colors.includes("green");
const isYellowIncluded = colors.includes("yellow");

console.log(isGreenIncluded); // Output: true
console.log(isYellowIncluded); // Output: false
```

2. Using startIndex

```javascript
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "kiwi", "banana"];

// Check if "banana" is included starting from index 2
const isBananaIncluded = fruits.includes("banana", 2);

console.log(isBananaIncluded); // Output: true (second "banana" is included in the array)
```

### Key Points

* includes() returns a boolean (true or false) indicating whether the array contains the specified value.
* It performs a strict equality comparison (===) to determine if the value exists in the array.
* If startIndex is provided, the search starts from that index; otherwise, it starts from index 0.

### Use Cases

* Checking for the existence of a specific value in an array.
* Implementing simple conditional logic based on the presence of a value in an array.
* Avoiding the need to retrieve the index when only interested in determining presence.

### Considerations

* includes() is preferred over indexOf() when you only need to check for the existence of a value without caring about its index.
* For more complex conditions or when you need the index of the found value, use indexOf() or find() method.

### Compatibility

* includes() is part of ECMAScript 2016 (ES7) standard and is supported in modern browsers. For older browsers, consider using polyfills or alternative methods for similar functionality.

includes() is a straightforward method for checking the presence of values within arrays and is commonly used in JavaScript applications for basic value existence checks.

<hr style="background: red; border-radius: 2px;">

# 14. isArray()

Syntax ```Array.isArray(value)```

* value: The value to be checked.

```javascript
const array1 = [1, 2, 3];
const array2 = "hello";
const array3 = { name: "John", age: 30 };
const array4 = [];

console.log(Array.isArray(array1)); // Output: true
console.log(Array.isArray(array2)); // Output: false
console.log(Array.isArray(array3)); // Output: false
console.log(Array.isArray(array4)); // Output: true
```

### Key Points

* Array.isArray() is a static method of the Array object.
* It checks if the provided value is of type "object" and if its internal [[Class]] property is "Array".
* It's a reliable way to distinguish between arrays and other types of objects.
* This method is preferred over using instanceof Array, especially in scenarios where values may come from different JavaScript contexts (e.g., iframes) where instanceof might not work as expected.

### Use Cases

* Checking whether a variable or value is an array before performing array-specific operations.
* Validating function arguments to ensure they are arrays when expected.

### Considerations

* Array.isArray() is part of ECMAScript 5 (ES5) standard and is supported in all modern browsers.
* Be cautious when using Array.isArray() with objects that inherit from Array (e.g., arrays created in iframes). In such cases, Array.isArray() is more reliable than instanceof Array.
* For older environments that do not support Array.isArray(), you can use a polyfill or alternative type-checking methods.

### Compatibility

* Array.isArray() is widely supported in modern JavaScript environments and browsers.

Array.isArray() is a simple yet essential method for checking the type of values in JavaScript, particularly when dealing with arrays and array-like objects.

<hr style="background: red; border-radius: 2px;">

# 15. join()

Syntax ```const joinedString = array.join(separator);```

* separator (Optional): Specifies the string used to separate each element of the array in the resulting string. If omitted, elements are separated with a comma (,).

1. Using join() with Default Separator (Comma)

```javascript
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];

# const result = fruits.join();
console.log(result); // Output: "apple,banana,orange"
```

2. Using join() with Custom Separator

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const result = numbers.join(" - ");
console.log(result); // Output: "1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5"
```

3. Joining Array of Numbers into a CSV String

```javascript
const prices = [10, 20, 30, 40];

const csvString = prices.join(", ");
console.log(csvString); // Output: "10, 20, 30, 40"
```

4. Building URL Path from Array of Path Segments

```javascript
const pathSegments = ["users", "123", "profile"];

const urlPath = pathSegments.join("/");
console.log(urlPath); // Output: "users/123/profile"
```

### Key Points

* join() converts all elements of an array into strings and concatenates them using the specified separator.
* If no separator is provided, the default separator is a comma (,).
* The original array is not modified; join() returns a new string representing the joined elements.
* join() is particularly useful for converting arrays of strings into readable and formatted strings.

### Use Cases

* Converting an array of strings into a single string representation.
* Creating custom formatted strings from arrays (e.g., generating comma-separated values for CSV output).
* Building URL query strings or path segments from arrays of values.

### Considerations

* Use join() to convert array elements into a string representation when string concatenation is needed.
* Be mindful of the separator used with join() to ensure the resulting string format meets the desired requirements.
* join() is most commonly used with arrays of strings or values that can be converted to strings.

### Compatibility

* join() is part of ECMAScript 3 (ES3) standard and is supported in all modern browsers and JavaScript environments.

The join() method is a versatile and straightforward way to concatenate array elements into a string with a specified separator.

<hr style="background: red; border-radius: 2px;">

# 16. lastIndexOf()

Syntax ```const lastIndex = array.lastIndexOf(searchElement, fromIndex);```

* searchElement: The value to search for within the array.
* fromIndex (Optional): The index at which to start searching backwards. If omitted, the search starts from the last element (array.length - 1).

1. Finding the Last Index of an Element

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 5];

const lastIndex = numbers.lastIndexOf(2);
console.log(lastIndex); // Output: 4 (index of the last occurrence of value 2)
```

2. Specifying fromIndex

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 5];

const lastIndex = numbers.lastIndexOf(2, 3);
console.log(lastIndex); // Output: 1 (index of the last occurrence of value 2 before index 3)
```

3. Searching for Objects in an Array

```javascript
const users = [
  { id: 1, name: "Alice" },
  { id: 2, name: "Bob" },
  { id: 3, name: "Alice" }
];

// Find the index of the last occurrence of user with name "Alice"
const lastIndex = users.lastIndexOf({ id: 1, name: "Alice" });
console.log(lastIndex); // Output: -1 (object comparison does not match)
```

### Key Points

* lastIndexOf() searches the array backwards, starting from the specified fromIndex (or the last element if fromIndex is not provided).
* It returns the index of the last occurrence of searchElement within the array.
* If the searchElement is not found, lastIndexOf() returns -1.

### Use Cases

* Finding the last occurrence of a specific element in an array.
* Implementing reverse search functionality for arrays.
* Checking for the existence of a value from the end of the array.

### Considerations

* lastIndexOf() uses strict equality (===) to compare values.
* Objects and arrays are compared by reference, not by value, so searching for objects or arrays may not yield expected results.
* Use fromIndex to start the search from a specific position in the array.

### Compatibility

* lastIndexOf() is part of ECMAScript 5 (ES5) standard and is supported in all modern browsers and JavaScript environments.

The lastIndexOf() method is useful for finding the last occurrence of a value within an array and is commonly used in scenarios where reverse search or last occurrence lookup is required.

# 17. length()


```javascript
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];

console.log(fruits.length); // Output: 3 (number of elements in the array)
```

### Key Points

* length is a property, not a method, so you access it directly without using parentheses.
* For arrays, length indicates the number of elements in the array.
* For strings, length indicates the number of characters in the string.
* The value of length is always one more than the highest index in the array (since array indices are zero-based).

### Use Cases

* Checking the number of elements in an array (array.length).
* Determining the length of a string (string.length) for validation or processing.
* Iterating over elements in an array using a loop with the length property.

### Considerations

* The value of length property is read-only and cannot be directly modified to change the size of an array or string.
* Be cautious of empty or undefined elements in an array when relying on length for iteration or processing.

### Compatibility

* length property is available for arrays and strings in all JavaScript environments and is widely supported.

Using length property is fundamental for working with arrays and strings in JavaScript, providing a simple and efficient way to determine the size or length of data structures.

<hr style="background: red; border-radius: 2px;">

# 18. map()

It is used to create a new array by applying a provided function to each element of the original array. It does not mutate the original array; instead, it returns a new array with the results of applying the function to each element.

Syntax ```map((element, index, array) => {})```

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

// Map each number to its square
const squares = numbers.map((num) => {
  return num * num;
});

console.log(squares); // Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]
```

* The map() method iterates through each element of the numbers array.
* For each element (num), the provided function (num) => num * num is executed.
* The result of the function (square of each number) is added to the squares array, which becomes [1, 4, 9, 16].

1. Mapping Array of Strings to Uppercase

```javascript
const words = ["hello", "world", "javascript"];

// Map each word to uppercase
const uppercaseWords = words.map((word) => {
  return word.toUpperCase();
});

console.log(uppercaseWords); // Output: ["HELLO", "WORLD", "JAVASCRIPT"]
```

2. Mapping Array of Objects

```javascript
const persons = [
  { name: "Alice", age: 30 },
  { name: "Bob", age: 25 }
];

// Map persons array to array of names
const names = persons.map((person) => {
  return person.name;
});

console.log(names); // Output: ["Alice", "Bob"]
```

### Key Points

* map() creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.
* It does not mutate the original array; the original array remains unchanged.
* The callback function passed to map() can take up to three arguments (element, index, array), but usually, only element is necessary.
* The new array returned by map() has the same length as the original array.

### Use Cases

* Transforming each element of an array based on a specified logic or computation.
* Generating a new array of objects by modifying properties of existing objects.
* Converting an array of strings to an array of formatted strings or objects.

### Considerations

* Use map() when you want to transform each element of an array based on a specific logic or computation and collect the results into a new array.
* The callback function passed to map() should be pure (i.e., it should not modify the original array or external state) for predictable behavior.
* If the transformation logic is complex or involves asynchronous operations, consider using async/await or Promise.all() within the map() callback.

### Compatibility

* map() is part of ECMAScript 5 (ES5) standard and is supported in all modern browsers and JavaScript environments.

The map() method is a powerful tool for array manipulation in JavaScript, allowing for concise and expressive transformations of array elements.

<hr style="background: red; border-radius: 2px;">

# 19. pop()

Syntax ```const removedElement = array.pop();```

* removedElement: The element that was removed from the end of the array.

```javascript
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];

const removedFruit = fruits.pop();
console.log(removedFruit); // Output: "orange"

console.log(fruits); // Output: ["apple", "banana"]
```

* The pop() method is called on the fruits array, removing the last element "orange".
* The value "orange" is returned by pop() and stored in removedFruit.
* The modified fruits array now contains ["apple", "banana"].

```javascript
const numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40];

const lastNumber = numbers.pop();
console.log(lastNumber); // Output: 40

console.log(numbers); // Output: [10, 20, 30]
```

### Key Points

* pop() modifies the original array by removing the last element and returns the removed element.
* If the array is empty (has a length of 0) before pop() is called, it returns undefined and the array remains unchanged.
* The pop() operation is efficient because it only modifies the length of the array without iterating over all elements.

### Use Cases

* Removing the last element from an array when you no longer need it.
* Implementing a stack data structure where elements are added and removed from the end (LIFO - Last In, First Out).
* Dynamically managing arrays by removing elements based on specific conditions.

### Considerations

* pop() modifies the original array directly and does not create a new array.
* Ensure the array is not empty before calling pop() to avoid unexpected behavior (like removing undefined).

### Compatibility

* pop() is part of ECMAScript 3 (ES3) standard and is supported in all modern browsers and JavaScript environments.

The pop() method is a straightforward way to remove the last element from an array, useful in scenarios where you need to manage the content of arrays dynamically.

<hr style="background: red; border-radius: 2px;">

# 20. push()

Syntax ```const newLength = array.push(element1, element2, ...);```
* element1, element2, etc.: The elements to add to the end of the array.


```javascript
const fruits = ["apple", "banana"];

const newLength = fruits.push("orange", "grape");
console.log(newLength); // Output: 4 (length of the modified array)

console.log(fruits); // Output: ["apple", "banana", "orange", "grape"]
```

* The push() method is called on the fruits array with "orange" and "grape" as arguments.
* The elements "orange" and "grape" are added to the end of the fruits array.
* The new length of the fruits array (4) is returned by push() and stored in newLength.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

const newLength = numbers.push(4, 5, 6);
console.log(newLength); // Output: 6 (length of the modified array)

console.log(numbers); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

### Key Points

* push() modifies the original array by adding one or more elements to the end.
* It can accept multiple elements as arguments, each of which will be added to the end of the array in the order they are provided.
* The return value of push() is the new length of the array after the addition of elements.

### Use Cases

* Adding new elements to an array dynamically, especially when the number of elements to add is not known beforehand.
* Building arrays by appending elements based on specific conditions or processing.

### Considerations

* push() modifies the original array directly and does not create a new array.
* The elements provided to push() are added to the end of the array in the order they are passed as arguments.
* The push() method is often used in combination with other array methods like pop(), shift(), or unshift() to manipulate arrays.

### Compatibility

* push() is part of ECMAScript 3 (ES3) standard and is supported in all modern browsers and JavaScript environments.

The push() method is a fundamental tool for adding elements to arrays dynamically, providing flexibility in array manipulation.

<hr style="background: red; border-radius: 2px;">

# 21. reduce()

Syntax

```javascript
const result = array.reduce((accumulator, currentValue, index, array) => {
  // Return updated accumulator value based on currentValue
}, initialValue);
```

* accumulator: A variable to store the accumulated result of the reducer function.
* currentValue: The current element being processed in the array.
* index (Optional): The index of the current element being processed.
* array (Optional): The array reduce() was called upon.
* initialValue (Optional): An initial value for the accumulator. If omitted, the first element of the array will be used as the initial accumulator value.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Calculate the sum of all elements in the array
const sum = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {
  return accumulator + currentValue;
}, 0);

console.log(sum); // Output: 15 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5)
```

* The reduce() method is used on the numbers array to calculate the sum of all elements.
* The reducer function (accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue adds each currentValue to the accumulator starting from an initial value of 0.
* The final result (15) is stored in the sum variable.

1. Flattening an Array of Arrays

```javascript
const arrays = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]];

const flattened = arrays.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {
  return accumulator.concat(currentValue);
}, []);

console.log(flattened); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

2. Grouping Objects by Property

```javascript
const products = [
  { name: "Apple", category: "Fruit" },
  { name: "Carrot", category: "Vegetable" },
  { name: "Orange", category: "Fruit" }
];

const groupedProducts = products.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {
  (accumulator[currentValue.category] = accumulator[currentValue.category] || []).push(currentValue);
  return accumulator;
}, {});

console.log(groupedProducts);
// Output:
// {
//   Fruit: [{ name: "Apple", category: "Fruit" }, { name: "Orange", category: "Fruit" }],
//   Vegetable: [{ name: "Carrot", category: "Vegetable" }]
// }
```

### Key Points

* reduce() iterates through each element of the array and applies the reducer function to accumulate a single value.
* It can be used to perform various operations like summing elements, calculating averages, flattening arrays, etc.
* The reducer function can return any type of value (not just numerical values).

### Use Cases

* Calculating aggregate values (e.g., sum, average) from array elements.
* Flattening arrays of arrays into a single array.
* Grouping elements based on specific criteria.

### Considerations

* Provide an initialValue as the second argument to reduce() if the array may be empty or if you need a specific starting value for the accumulator.
* Ensure the reducer function is pure (i.e., it does not modify external state) for predictable behavior.

### Compatibility

* reduce() is part of ECMAScript 5 (ES5) standard and is supported in all modern browsers and JavaScript environments.

The reduce() method is a powerful tool for processing arrays and transforming them into single values or aggregating data based on specific logic. It provides flexibility and expressiveness for array operations.

<hr style="background: red; border-radius: 2px;">

# 22. reduceRight()

Syntax

```javascript
const result = array.reduceRight((accumulator, currentValue, index, array) => {
  // Return updated accumulator value based on currentValue
}, initialValue);
```

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Calculate the product of all elements in the array from right to left
const product = numbers.reduceRight((accumulator, currentValue) => {
  return accumulator * currentValue;
}, 1);

console.log(product); // Output: 120 (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)
```

* The reduceRight() method is used on the numbers array to calculate the product of all elements from right to left.
* The reducer function (accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator * currentValue multiplies each currentValue with the accumulator starting from an initial value of 1.
* The final result (120) is stored in the product variable.

1. Concatenating String Elements in Reverse Order

```javascript
const words = ["Hello", "World", "!"];

const reversedString = words.reduceRight((accumulator, currentValue) => {
  return accumulator + " " + currentValue;
}, "");

# console.log(reversedString.trim()); // Output: "! World Hello"
```

### Key Points

* reduceRight() processes the array in reverse order, starting from the last element towards the first element.
* It is useful when the order of processing matters, such as when dealing with operations like concatenation or operations dependent on the rightmost elements.
* Like reduce(), the reducer function can return any type of value.

### Use Cases

* Processing array elements in reverse order (right to left) based on specific logic.
* Concatenating string elements in reverse order.
* Operations that require dependency on the rightmost elements of the array.

### Considerations

* Provide an initialValue as the second argument to reduceRight() if the array may be empty or if you need a specific starting value for the accumulator.
* Ensure the reducer function is pure (i.e., it does not modify external state) for predictable behavior.

### Compatibility

* reduceRight() is part of ECMAScript 5 (ES5) standard and is supported in all modern browsers and JavaScript environments.

The reduceRight() method is a specialized version of reduce() that allows processing array elements in reverse order. It can be particularly useful for scenarios where the order of processing matters, such as string concatenation or operations that depend on the rightmost elements of the array.

<hr style="background: red; border-radius: 2px;">

# 23. reverse()

Syntax ```array.reverse()```

```javascript
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
array.reverse();

console.log(array); // Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

* The reverse() method is called on the array.
* The order of elements in array is reversed in-place.
* The modified array now contains [5, 4, 3, 2, 1].

```javascript
const names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David"];
names.reverse();

console.log(names); // Output: ["David", "Charlie", "Bob", "Alice"]
```

### Key Points

* reverse() mutates the original array and does not return a new array.
* The first element becomes the last, the second element becomes the second-to-last, and so on.
* The reversal is done in-place, meaning it directly modifies the original array.
* The reverse() method affects the array permanently unless reversed back with another call to reverse().

### Use Cases

* Reversing the order of elements in an array to display or process them in a different sequence.
* Implementing custom algorithms or data transformations that require reversing the order of array elements.

### Considerations

* reverse() modifies the original array directly and does not create a copy of the array.
* If you need to preserve the original array while reversing its order, create a copy of the array using slice() before calling reverse().

### Compatibility

* reverse() is part of ECMAScript 1 (ES1) standard and is supported in all modern browsers and JavaScript environments.

The reverse() method is a straightforward way to reverse the order of elements in an array, useful in scenarios where the processing order of array elements needs to be changed.

> * Use reduceRight() to calculate aggregate values or perform computations that depend on the rightmost elements of an array.
> 
> In summary, reverse() and reduceRight() are distinct methods with different purposes and behaviors. reverse() is for reversing the order of elements in an array, while # reduceRight() is for processing elements in reverse order and reducing the array to a single value based on a function. Choose the method that best fits your specific use case when working with arrays in JavaScript. 


<hr style="background: red; border-radius: 2px;">

# 24. shift()

Syntax ```const removedElement = array.shift();```
* removedElement: The element that was removed from the beginning of the array.


```javascript
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];

const removedFruit = fruits.shift();
console.log(removedFruit); // Output: "apple"

console.log(fruits); // Output: ["banana", "orange"]
```
* The shift() method is called on the fruits array, removing the first element "apple".
* The value "apple" is returned by shift() and stored in removedFruit.
* The modified fruits array now contains ["banana", "orange"].


```javascript
const colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];

const removedColor = colors.shift();
console.log(removedColor); // Output: "red"

console.log(colors); // Output: ["green", "blue"]
```

### Key Points
* shift() modifies the original array by removing the first element and returns that element.
* If the array is empty (has a length of 0) before shift() is called, it returns undefined and the array remains unchanged.
* All remaining elements in the array are shifted to a lower index position after the removal of the first element.

### Use Cases
* Removing the first element from an array when you no longer need it.
* Implementing a queue data structure where elements are added to the end and removed from the beginning (FIFO - First In, First Out).

### Considerations
* shift() modifies the original array directly and does not create a new array.
* If you need to remove elements from the end of an array, use the pop() method instead.

### Compatibility
* shift() is part of ECMAScript 3 (ES3) standard and is supported in all modern browsers and JavaScript environments.

The shift() method is useful for removing and retrieving the first element of an array, particularly in scenarios where elements are managed in a FIFO (First In, First Out) order. 

<hr style="background: red; border-radius: 2px;">

# 25. slice()

Syntax ```const newArray = array.slice(startIndex, endIndex);```
* **startIndex (Optional):** The zero-based index at which to begin extraction. If omitted, slice() starts from index 0.
* **endIndex (Optional):** The zero-based index before which to end extraction. slice() extracts up to, but does not include, endIndex. If omitted, slice() extracts through the end of the array (array.length).


```javascript
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "mango", "kiwi"];

// Extract elements from index 1 to index 3 (not including index 3)
const selectedFruits = fruits.slice(1, 4);
console.log(selectedFruits); // Output: ["banana", "orange", "mango"]

// Extract elements from index 2 to the end of the array
const remainingFruits = fruits.slice(2);
console.log(remainingFruits); // Output: ["orange", "mango", "kiwi"]

// Copy the entire array (shallow copy)
const copiedFruits = fruits.slice();
console.log(copiedFruits); // Output: ["apple", "banana", "orange", "mango", "kiwi"]
```

```javascript

```

### Key Points
* slice() extracts a section of an array and returns a new array without modifying the original array.
* The startIndex and endIndex parameters specify the range of elements to extract. The extracted elements include startIndex but exclude endIndex.
* If startIndex is negative, it specifies an offset from the end of the array. For example, -1 refers to the last element of the array.
* If endIndex is omitted, slice() extracts through the end of the array (array.length).
* Use slice() to create shallow copies of arrays or to extract specific subsets of an array for further processing.

### Use Cases
* Extracting a portion of an array for manipulation without affecting the original array.
* Implementing pagination or filtering logic by selecting specific ranges of elements from an array.
* Creating shallow copies of arrays to perform safe operations without mutating the original data.

### Additional Notes
* slice() can be used with negative indices to extract elements from the end of the array.
* Using slice() without arguments (array.slice()) creates a shallow copy of the entire array.

### Considerations
* slice() does not modify the original array; it returns a new array containing the selected elements.
* Take care when using slice() with large arrays, as it creates a new array which consumes memory proportional to the extracted elements.

### Compatibility
* slice() is part of ECMAScript 3 (ES3) standard and is supported in all modern browsers and JavaScript environments.


# The slice() method is versatile and commonly used for extracting and manipulating subsets of arrays in JavaScript, providing a convenient way to work with array data.

<hr style="background: red; border-radius: 2px;">

# 26. some()

It is used to test whether at least one element in an array satisfies a specified condition implemented by a provided function. It returns true if the callback function returns true for at least one element in the array; otherwise, it returns false.

Syntax ```array.some(callback(element, index, array));```

**Return Value :** true if the callback function returns true for at least one element in the array; otherwise, false.


```javascript
const numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40];

// Check if at least one number is greater than 25
const hasNumberGreaterThan25 = numbers.some((num) => {
  return num > 25;
});

console.log(hasNumberGreaterThan25); // Output: true
```
* The some() method is called on the numbers array to check if there is at least one number greater than 25.
* The callback function (num) => num > 25 tests each element to determine if it is greater than 25.
* Since 30 and 40 are greater than 25, the some() method returns true.

```javascript
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];

// Check if any fruit starts with the letter 'b'
const hasFruitStartingWithB = fruits.some((fruit) => {
  return fruit.startsWith('b');
});

console.log(hasFruitStartingWithB); // Output: true
```


### Key Points
* some() executes the callback function once for each element in the array until it finds an element for which the callback returns true.
* It does not modify the original array.
* The iteration stops as soon as some() finds an element that satisfies the condition, providing early termination if the condition is met early in the iteration.

### Use Cases
* Checking for the presence of specific conditions or properties in an array.
* Validating if at least one element meets certain criteria before performing further operations.
* Implementing conditional logic based on array elements.

### Considerations
* some() returns false for an empty array because there are no elements to test against the condition.
* The callback function should be a pure function that does not modify the array or external state for predictable behavior.

### Compatibility
* some() is part of ECMAScript 5 (ES5) standard and is supported in all modern browsers and JavaScript environments.

# The some() method is useful for checking array elements against specific conditions and determining if at least one element satisfies the condition. It provides a concise way to perform boolean checks on array data. 

<hr style="background: red; border-radius: 2px;">

# 27. sort()

Syntax ```array.sort(compareFunction);```
* **compareFunction (Optional):** A function that defines the sort order. It should return a negative value if the first argument should come before the second, a positive value if the second argument should come before the first, or zero if they are equal.

1. (Default Sorting)
```javascript
const fruits = ["banana", "orange", "apple", "mango"];
# fruits.sort();

console.log(fruits); // Output: ["apple", "banana", "mango", "orange"]
```
* The sort() method is called on the fruits array, which sorts the elements in lexicographical order (alphabetically by default).
* The original fruits array is modified to [ "apple", "banana", "mango", "orange" ].

2. Custom Sorting with compareFunction
```javascript
const numbers = [3, 8, 1, 5, 10];
numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b); // Ascending order

console.log(numbers); // Output: [1, 3, 5, 8, 10]
```
* The sort() method is called on the numbers array with a custom compareFunction that sorts the numbers in ascending order.
* The compareFunction (a, b) => a - b returns a negative value if a should come before b (indicating ascending order).
* The original numbers array is sorted and modified to [1, 3, 5, 8, 10].


### Key Points
* By default, sort() converts elements to strings and sorts them lexicographically (i.e., alphabetically).
* Use a custom compareFunction to control the sorting behavior based on specific criteria (e.g., numerical order, object properties).
* The compareFunction should return a negative value to indicate that a should come before b, a positive value for the opposite, or zero if they are equal.
* sort() modifies the original array in place and returns a reference to the sorted array (although you typically don't need to use the return value).

### Use Cases
* Sorting arrays of strings or numbers into ascending or descending order.
* Sorting arrays of objects based on specific object properties.
* Implementing custom sorting logic for complex data structures.

### Additional Notes
* If the compareFunction returns inconsistent results (e.g., a - b and b - a within the same sort() call), the sorting order may be unpredictable.
* Be cautious when sorting arrays containing non-primitive data types (e.g., objects) as the default behavior may not produce the desired results. Use a custom compareFunction for complex sorting requirements.

### Considerations
* sort() modifies the original array directly and does not create a new array.
* The default sorting behavior may not always be suitable for non-string elements or complex data types. Use a custom compareFunction for precise control over sorting.

### Compatibility
* sort() is part of ECMAScript 1 (ES1) standard and is supported in all modern browsers and JavaScript environments.

# The sort() method is fundamental for sorting array elements in JavaScript, offering flexibility with custom sorting criteria. 

<hr style="background: red; border-radius: 2px;">

# 28. splice()

Syntax ```array.splice(startIndex, deleteCount, item1, item2, ...);```
* **startIndex:** The index at which to start changing the array. If negative, it specifies an offset from the end of the array.
* **deleteCount (Optional):** The number of elements to remove starting from startIndex. If omitted or if greater than the number of elements from startIndex to the end of the array, all elements from startIndex to the end of the array will be removed.
* **item1, item2, ... (Optional):** Elements to add to the array starting at startIndex after the removal of deleteCount elements.


1. Removing Elements
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const removed = numbers.splice(1, 2); // Remove 2 elements starting from index 1

console.log(removed); // Output: [2, 3]
console.log(numbers); // Output: [1, 4, 5]
```

2. Replacing Elements
```javascript
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
fruits.splice(1, 1, "mango", "kiwi"); // Replace 1 element at index 1 with "mango" and "kiwi"

console.log(fruits); // Output: ["apple", "mango", "kiwi", "orange"]
```

3. Adding Elements
```javascript
const colors = ["red", "blue"];
colors.splice(1, 0, "green", "yellow"); // Insert "green" and "yellow" at index 1

console.log(colors); // Output: ["red", "green", "yellow", "blue"]
```



### Return Value
* An array containing the elements that were removed. If no elements were removed, an empty array is returned.

### Key Points
* splice() modifies the original array by changing its contents based on the specified parameters.
* Elements can be removed, replaced, and/or added using splice() in a single operation.
* The startIndex can be negative to specify an offset from the end of the array.
* If deleteCount is 0 and additional items are provided (item1, item2, ...), elements are inserted at the specified startIndex without removing any elements.
* splice() returns an array containing the removed elements, allowing you to capture and use those elements if needed.

### Use Cases
* Removing specific elements from an array based on their indices.
* Replacing elements at specific positions with new values.
* Dynamically inserting new elements into an array at desired positions.

### Considerations
* Be cautious when using splice() within loops, as it can modify the array length and affect loop behavior.
* Use slice() instead of splice() if you want to extract a portion of an array without modifying the original array.

### Compatibility
* splice() is part of ECMAScript 3 (ES3) standard and is supported in all modern browsers and JavaScript environments.

# The splice() method is a powerful tool for manipulating arrays in JavaScript, allowing for flexible operations to remove, replace, and insert elements efficiently.

# 29. toString()

# Syntax ```array.toString()```

```javascript
const colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
# const colorsString = colors.toString();

console.log(colorsString); // Output: "red,green,blue"
```
* The toString() method is called on the colors array.
* Each element of the colors array ("red", "green", "blue") is converted to a string and concatenated together with commas in between.
* The resulting string "red,green,blue" is stored in the colorsString variable.


### Return Value
* The toString() method returns a string representation of the array, where each element is converted to a string and separated by commas.

### Key Points
* toString() is automatically called when an array is coerced to a string context, such as when using array interpolation in template literals or concatenation with strings.
* The default behavior of toString() is to convert each element of the array to a string using the Array.prototype.join() method with a comma (, ) as the separator.
* If an element of the array is null or undefined, it is converted to an empty string ("") in the resulting string.
* The original array is not modified by toString(); it only returns a string representation of the array.

### Use Cases
* Converting an array to a string for display or logging purposes.
* Interpolating array elements into strings for UI or text-based output.
* Serializing array data for storage or transmission in a text format.

### Additional Notes
* The join() method provides similar functionality to toString() and allows you to specify a custom separator for joining array elements into a string.
* Be cautious when using toString() on arrays containing complex objects or nested arrays, as it only provides a shallow string representation of the array contents.

### Compatibility
* toString() is part of ECMAScript 1 (ES1) standard and is supported in all modern browsers and JavaScript environments.

# The toString() method is a convenient way to convert arrays to strings in JavaScript, providing a straightforward representation of array elements as a single string.

# 30. toLocaleString()

Syntax ```array.toLocaleString([locales[, options]]);```
* **locales (Optional):** A string with a BCP 47 language tag, or an array of such strings, indicating the desired locale(s) for the formatting. If omitted, the default locale of the execution environment is used.
* **options (Optional):** An object specifying configuration options for the formatting, such as style or currency. This parameter is typically used for number formatting.


```javascript
const numbers = [1000, 20000, 300000];

// Display numbers in localized format
const formattedNumbers = numbers.toLocaleString('en-US');

console.log(formattedNumbers);
// Output (in English, US locale): "1,000, 20,000, 300,000"
```
* The toLocaleString() method is called on the numbers array with the locale 'en-US' specified.
* Each number in the numbers array is formatted according to the locale's number formatting rules, which includes comma separators for thousands.


1. Date Formatting
```javascript
const dates = [new Date('2023-06-15'), new Date('2024-09-30')];

// Display dates in localized date format
const formattedDates = dates.toLocaleString('en-US', { dateStyle: 'medium' });

console.log(formattedDates);
// Output (in English, US locale):
// "Jun 15, 2023, 12:00:00 AM, Sep 30, 2024, 12:00:00 AM"
```

2. Currency Formatting
```javascript
const prices = [100, 250, 500];

// Display prices in localized currency format (USD)
const formattedPrices = prices.toLocaleString('en-US', { style: 'currency', currency: 'USD' });

console.log(formattedPrices);
// Output (in English, US locale): "$100.00, $250.00, $500.00"
```


### Localization Features
# The toLocaleString() method can handle various localization features based on the locale settings, including:

* Number formatting: This includes decimal separators, digit grouping (thousands separators), and other numeric conventions.
* Date and time formatting: This includes date and time formats based on region-specific conventions.
* Currency formatting: This includes currency symbols, placement, and numeric formatting rules for monetary values.

### Return Value
* The toLocaleString() method returns a string representation of the array elements formatted according to the specified locale and options.

### Use Cases
* Displaying numeric data (such as prices, quantities) in a user-friendly format based on the user's language and region.
* Showing dates and times in a localized format that adheres to regional conventions.
* Presenting array data in a culturally appropriate manner for international audiences.

### Compatibility
* toLocaleString() is part of ECMAScript 3 (ES3) standard and is supported in all modern browsers and JavaScript environments.

# The toLocaleString() method is a powerful tool for formatting array data in a way that respects the user's locale preferences. It's particularly useful for creating user interfaces that display data in a language-sensitive manner.

# 31. unshift()

Syntax ```array.unshift(element1, element2, ..., elementN);```
* element1, element2, ..., elementN: Elements to add to the beginning of the array.


```javascript
const fruits = ["orange", "apple", "banana"];

// Add elements to the beginning of the array
const newLength = fruits.unshift("mango", "kiwi");

console.log(fruits); // Output: ["mango", "kiwi", "orange", "apple", "banana"]
console.log(newLength); // Output: 5 (length of the modified array)
```
* The unshift() method is called on the fruits array to add "mango" and "kiwi" to the beginning.
* The modified fruits array becomes ["mango", "kiwi", "orange", "apple", "banana"].
* The newLength variable stores the new length of the array after insertion, which is 5.


### Return Value
* The unshift() method returns the new length of the array after the elements have been added.

### Key Points
* unshift() modifies the original array by adding elements to the beginning and shifting existing elements to higher indices.
* Multiple elements can be added in a single unshift() operation, and they will appear in the array in the order they are provided.
* The unshift() method directly modifies the array and does not create a new array.

### Use Cases
* Prepending new elements to an array, such as adding items to the beginning of a list.
* Dynamically building arrays where elements need to be inserted at the start based on specific conditions.

### Additional Notes
* The unshift() method can be less efficient for large arrays compared to push() for adding elements to the end, as it requires shifting existing elements to higher indices.
* Be cautious when using unshift() inside loops or performance-critical code, especially with large arrays.

### Compatibility
* unshift() is part of ECMAScript 3 (ES3) standard and is supported in all modern browsers and JavaScript environments.

# The unshift() method is a convenient way to prepend elements to an array, allowing for flexible manipulation of array contents by adding new items at the beginning.
